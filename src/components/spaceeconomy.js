            Since the first human breakthrough in space exploration, public and
            national interest has never ceased to grow. Although modern society
            perceives that space is relatively distant from human life, it is
            more important than many people think. Legislative changes,
            technological breakthroughs, social movements, and shifts in the

            In the beginning, the main actors in outer space were exclusively
            national states. Today, space is no longer just for them. During the
            outgoing 2010â€™s, the main space trend was the expanding role of
            private companies and private initiatives. In response to this trend

            growth of this economy has fostered new innovations; space travel

            it also gave rise to new technologies that we consume on a daily
            basis. Smartphone GPS and temporal data are actively implemented to
            coordinate work on the Internet. Without these technologies, a range

            to determine whether individual satellites or satellite networks
            meet the guidelines for long-term space sustainability. The
            introduction of the Space Sustainability Rating system leads to more

            Space is responsible for the efficient operation of the global
            economy's critical information communications. This is where the
            fortunes of breakthrough science-based production, resource
            extraction and energy technologies are decided. The
            commercialization of space activities should be maintained at a
            market level. This requires a reassessment of its performance
            criteria at government and industry level. Furthermore, space
            commercialization requires investing substantial financial resources
            over long periods of time, which implies finding effective
            mechanisms for combining the interests of the state and business.
            Such a partnership approach will help to achieve tangible social and
            economic benefits from the space industry.
