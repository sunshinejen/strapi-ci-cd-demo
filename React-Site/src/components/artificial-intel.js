            is not just the introduction of new technologies, it goes deeper and
            involves a shift in mindset, behavior and culture. Its protagonist,
            artificial intelligence, is gaining momentum - it's a fait accompli.
            But how many are thinking about what it will lead to and what
            questions the development of AI poses to society? Should it be seen
            as an interdisciplinary component, including questions of sociology
            and philosophy? There is no clear answer if the current world
            situation represents Taleb's "Black Swan", although attention to

            Undoubtedly, viewing the success of digitalization can come from
            many angles. However, the most influential of these is automation.
            AI technology accompanies people in medicine, economics, education,
            science, retail, automotive and manufacturing. Researchers and
            entrepreneurs, in fact, don't have enough of it. Some are saying
            that the use of AI should be encouraged, thereby enhancing human
            capabilities. Others, and this is really another vector, about
            creating machines that will understand us on a psychological level.
            A third group scares people with a technological singularity. Going
            back 5 years, media headlines were increasingly focused on the
            coming dystopia/utopia of artificial intelligence. Consequently, the
            average person is faced with the question of who is to be believed.
            Naturally, the decision to attend a Miku Hatsune concert is a
            personal matter. Nevertheless, letâ€™s pause for a moment and
            appreciate how far technology has come. Where is the fine line
            between understanding that intelligent automation is a supplement to
            human effort, not a replacement for it, and whether it should be
            seen as a panacea?

            on devices that could solve fairly complex problems, the global
            scientific community has been interested in the problem of AI. At
            Turing's suggestion, an intelligent machine is defined as one that
            cannot be distinguished from a human being. Conversely, the American
            scientist John Searle, in his article{" "}
            <a

            , which has become chrestomatically famous, turned to criticism of
            the theoretical claims of artificial intelligence. His "Chinese Room
            " experiment suggests that artificial intelligence cannot be equated
            with natural intelligence, as the principles of their operation are
            quite different. Thus, he refutes the "strong version" of artificial
            intelligence, which suggests that a computer can have the ability to
            think and comprehend on a par with a human. At the same time, Searle
            supports the "weak version" of artificial intelligence, according to
            which mental processes can be modeled by a computer program. The
            experiment provoked a considerable academic backlash and an intense
            debate which is still going on. In particular, many critics have
            pointed out that Searle in his experiment inappropriately identifies
            the person in the room with the subject of Chinese comprehension,
            which should, in their view, be recognized as the entire system
            consisting of the room, the rulebook and the person. The answer to
            who stands right is, at the moment, impossible to give. However, one
            conclusion can still be reached. To set up the human-machine
            relationship, we need to listen to a variety of experts who are able
            to agree on concepts and translate them into context. AI philosophy,
            being both a philosophy of science and a philosophy of technology,
            considers artificial intelligence as a phenomenon of society,
            culture and cognition, on the one hand, and tries to comprehend its
            nature and evaluate its impact on our reality, on the other.
            Therefore, not allowing our civilization to forget that the time of
            reflection has come.

            use of artificial intelligence units in general. Their solution is
            mainly aimed at preventing harm to society and the individual from
            mass use. One primitive example: an unmanned car ran over a person.
            Whose fault was it? The programmer? The owner of the car or the
            manufacturer? Slightly less primitive, the use of{" "}

            . Preventive regulation could significantly reduce the degree of
            uncertainty in risk management issues related to the legal
            responsibility for the actions of an AI unit. The second group looks
            at specific (socially useful) areas of activity. It could be the

            . Detailed legal regulation needs to be developed for each
            individual use of artificial intelligence. Given the dynamics of the
            development of technologies and AI units, flexible legal regulation
            in this group may be more effective. Public authorities may not have
            sufficient information at the stages of their early development to
            develop appropriate legal regulation. Formation of legal regulation
            of artificial intelligence technologies is only at the beginning,
            but it may evolve into full-fledged complex institutes of law and
            institutes of legislation, possibly even into branches and
            sub-branches of law and legislation.

            Meanwhile, the ethics of AI is emerging as an area of research.
            Developments in this area have led to the emergence of a number of

            is a particularly noteworthy one. Work has begun on the creation of
            regulatory and technical documents capable of laying the foundation
            for ethical patterns of "behavior" of AI systems. Studies in this
            area are leading to the creation of{" "}

            . Their principles can be generally described as: the technology
            must not violate privacy, must not discriminate on any grounds, must
            not cause harm to its creator, must be fully controlled by him, and
            must not violate other human rights. An even more complex issue is
            related to the social adaptation of AI, the division of human and AI
            roles in the real sectors of the economy and social sphere, the
            mutual intellectual influence of human and artificial intelligence,
            which may lead not only to mutual enrichment, but also to new risks
            and challenges for future generations. Additionally, the document{" "}

            Despite the serious challenges of implementing AI systems, the
            prospect of using them encourages the search for solutions to
            overcome the obstacles. Highly qualified specialists from around the
            world are constantly working on the development of this field. They
            are trying to understand how artificial intelligence can affect
            automation systems, national security, ethics, legislation, and the
            privacy of citizens. Indeed, artificial intelligence plays a key
            role in the future of technological development and we are forced to
            choose between great possibilities and great dangers at some point.
            The main conclusion is to consider artificial intelligence as an
            interdisciplinary field, encompassing linguistics, philosophy,
            neuroscience and psychology. In this way, it is possible to abandon
            the fantastic fear of "machine uprising" and build a utilitarian
            useful relationship between AI and humans.
